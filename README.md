# Send your movies through time

Make sure python >= 3.8 is installed and create a virtual environment if you like.

Builds upon [Hachoir](https://hachoir.readthedocs.io):
```bash
pip3 install hachoir
```

```bash
python3 timemachine.py
```

The CLI will tell you the rest.
Very early version, do not expect much.
By now only *.MOV videos are supported.

The asterisk as expected; no guarantees, do backups, be brave...
